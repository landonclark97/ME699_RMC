### Broad area/overview

This paper seeks to serve as a foundational piece of literature proving that, when tuned properly, a PID controller can guarantee semiglobal stability and small arbitrary errors in joint trajectories of robot manipulators. It also provides an effective, and mathematically proven, set of tuning guidelines for the PID parameters based on the system stability. Through the use of feedback compensation and a reduced-order error observer, the proposed solution was able to produce satisfactory results.
