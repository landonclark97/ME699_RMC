### Instructions
1. Type `include("Assignment3.jl")` to run the file, norm errors for both controller are less than 0.01, (PD: 0.0013, CTC:0.0093). To change between PD control and CTC control, just simply change the control part in the `problem` at the `line: 73`. Use _**control_CTC!**_ or  _**control_PD!**_
4. The P value under _**control_CTC!**_ shows how small we can get the Kp with respect to _**control_PD!**_, P=0.4 is the smallest proportion we can get the error less than 0.01. _Note_: the Kd in the _**control_CTC!**_ is 10 time larger than _**control_PD!**_ to eliminate the oscilation at beginning.
