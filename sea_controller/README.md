# Control of Simulated Under-damped Series Elastic Actuated Robotic Arm with Reinforcement Learning Algorithms
control project aimed at controlling 3-DOF SEA robot with reinforcement learning algorithms (DDPG and PPO). requires tensorflow, numpy, and pybullet to be installed as well as possible other dependencies.
for original ddpg code see: https://github.com/keras-team/keras-io/blob/master/examples/rl/ddpg_pendulum.py
for original ppo code see: https://github.com/Derekabc/ppo_tf

## DDPG
* DDPG implementation can be found in the ddpg directory.
* to run, move to ddpg directory and execute `python ddpg.py`


## PPO
* PPO implementation can be found in the ppo directory.
* to run, move to the ppo directory and execute `python main.py`
